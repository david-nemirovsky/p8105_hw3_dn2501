## Problem 1

Load the instacart dataset:

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. There are user and
order variables such as user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour.
There are also item variables such as name, aisle, department, and
numeric code.

How many aisles, and which are the most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Let’s make a plot:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle,n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apples vs Ice Cream:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

Load and tidy the accelerometer dataset:

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute", 
    names_prefix = "activity.", 
    values_to = "activity"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day_type = case_when(
      day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday") ~ "weekend",
      day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") ~ "weekday")
    ) %>% 
  relocate(week, day_type) %>% 
  mutate(
    week = factor(week), 
    day_type = factor(day_type), 
    day = factor(day),
    minute = as.double(minute))
```

The `accel_df` dataset contains 50400 rows and 6 columns. It shows the
activity of a 63-year-old male with a BMI of 25 diagnosed with
congestive heart failure over the course of 5 weeks, with activity
observations recorded every minute over this time period. The variables
included are week, type of day, some day ID, day, minute, and amount of
activity done throughout each minute recorded.

Create a table for total activity for each day:

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```

| week | day       | total\_activity |
| :--- | :-------- | --------------: |
| 1    | Friday    |          480543 |
| 1    | Monday    |           78828 |

| 1    | Thursday  |          355924 |
| 1    | Tuesday   |          307094 |
| 1    | Wednesday |          340115 |

| 3    | Friday    |          467420 |

| 3    | Saturday  |          382928 |
| 3    | Sunday    |          467052 |
| 3    | Thursday  |          371230 |
| 3    | Tuesday   |          381507 |
| 3    | Wednesday |          468869 |
| 4    | Friday    |          154049 |
| 4    | Monday    |          409450 |
| 4    | Saturday  |            1440 |
| 4    | Sunday    |          260617 |
| 4    | Thursday  |          340291 |
| 4    | Tuesday   |          319568 |
| 4    | Wednesday |          434460 |
| 5    | Friday    |          620860 |
| 5    | Monday    |          389080 |
| 5    | Saturday  |            1440 |
| 5    | Sunday    |          138421 |
| 5    | Thursday  |          549658 |
| 5    | Tuesday   |          367824 |
| 5    | Wednesday |          445366 |

According to the table, this 63-year-old appeared to be most active on
Fridays, in general. His activity seemed relatively uniform for all
other days, however it is important to note that in the last two
Saturdays (Weeks 4 and 5), he recorded the lowest amount of activity
possible. Maybe he did not wear his accelerometer at all those days, or
he just wasn’t active at all, with the former being more likely.

Now, let’s make a plot of activity trends for each day throughout the
week\!

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(day, minute) %>% 
  summarize(mean_activity = mean(activity)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = mean_activity, color = day)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.67) +
  labs(
    title = "Activity Per Minute of the Day",
    x = "Minute of the Day",
    y = "Activity",
    legend = "Day of the Week") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, 1260, 1440), 
    labels = c("0", "180", "360", "540", "720", "900", "1080", "1260", "1440")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Throughout the first 400 minutes of the day, the man displays minimal
activity, which means he’s probably sleeping between the hours of 12AM
to 7AM. There appear to be consistent spikes at around the 630-680
minute marks on Sundays around 10-11AM, which could be due to scheduled
exercise. There also appear to be peaks on Fridays between the 1200 and
1300 minute marks, which could also be due to regularly scheduled
workouts. He is generally most active Sunday afternoon (from 10 - 11AM)
and Friday evening (from 8 - 10PM).
